The Progessive GAN is this folder was aimed to be developed to a resolution of 256x256 pixels, but due to less computational resources, its training wasn't able to go beyond faded 64x64 version

Due to the loss function used (Wasserstein Loss), the loss was numerously very high (20 digits above decimal place) after which it became nan and so no further training could took place
Images of such losses are attached.

The images and saved models of the latest trained version (64x64 faded) and the latest stable version (32x32 tuned) are attached.
